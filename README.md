# The Cocktail App

Welcome to The Cocktail App, a versatile beverage and cocktail application that showcases two parallel implementations using different architectural approaches. This repository embraces the principles of SOLID and Clean Architecture to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **MVI and XML Views**
  - Explore the MVI architecture combined with XML-based views for one version of The Cocktail App.
- **MVVM and Jetpack Compose**
  - Experience the MVVM architecture with Jetpack Compose for a modern and reactive UI in the other version.

## Third-Party Integrations

- **Coil (Jetpack Compose)**
  - Utilizes Coil for efficient image loading and display within Jetpack Compose.
- **Glide (XML)**
  - Employs Glide for seamless image loading and handling in the XML-based version.
- **Turbine (Testing)**
  - Incorporates Turbine for testing MutableStateFlow, following best practices outlined in the [Android Developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/test?hl=es-419).
- **Coroutines**
  - Implements coroutines for asynchronous programming, enhancing the app's responsiveness.
- **Lottie**
  - Integrates Lottie for high-quality animations, adding flair to The Cocktail App.
- **Moshi and OkHTTP3**
  - Utilizes Moshi for JSON parsing and OkHTTP3 for efficient network operations.

## Architecture and Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles**
  - Adheres to SOLID principles to enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Clean Architecture**
  - Implements Clean Architecture, separating the app into distinct modules for enhanced modularity and maintainability.

## Module Structure

1. **app Module**
   - Main application module orchestrating the integration of the data, domain, and presentation layers.

2. **data Module**
   - Handles data-related operations and interacts with external sources.

3. **domain Module**
   - Contains the business logic and use cases, serving as the core functionality of The Cocktail App.

4. **presentation Module**
   - Manages the user interface and presentation logic, incorporating Jetpack Compose components for the Jetpack Compose version and utilizing Material 3 design principles. Also, uses XML views for the other version.

## Asynchronous Programming

- **Coroutines**
  - Implements coroutines for asynchronous programming, enhancing the app's responsiveness. Details on coroutine usage can be found in a dedicated section or document within the project.

## Dependency Injection

- **Dagger/Hilt**
  - Leverages Dagger/Hilt for efficient dependency injection, promoting modular and testable code.

## Core Framework and Modules

- **Custom Core Framework**
  - Includes three essential modules: mzs-data, mzs-domain, and mzs-presentation. Owned by the developer, these modules provide foundational files and Jetpack Compose components for efficient app development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-cocktail-app.git`
2. Open each application module in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the desired version of The Cocktail App.
